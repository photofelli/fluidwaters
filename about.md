Mojuba: an expansive memory refusing to be housed in any single place, bound by limits of time, 
enclosed within the outlines of a map, encased in the physicality of body, or imprisoned as exhibit in a 
museum.
- M. Jacqui Alexander

  
Fluid like the Water is an interdisciplinary project that uses Black thought, art and ritual
practice come together as activation around historical bodies of water that held importance to  
the diaspora. Bringing together installation, performance, and remembrance.
Fluid like the Water brings together artists, culture bearers, and spiritual practitioners to
waterways around the Americas and Caribbean with hope to branch out to Africa. Started in 2023 as 
an idea by artists Felicita Felli Maynard and Jazmine Hayes, Fluid like the Water is a collabroation 
project between the two artists. Both Hayes and Maynard look to activate spaces and environments that 
think about the history of spaces for people of the African diaspora. 
How can we create spaces that 
               reflect on the 
                         energies of the past 
                                   present
                                         and futures? 

In her book Yabo, Alexis De Veaux beautifully describes the expansiveness that is memory in the chapter, 
The Succulent Membrane. She states, 

“History is a black hole. 
Black holes have membrane to prevent escape unaltered. 
Black holes may be portals to other histories. 
Narrative. 
What is now is the same as before: language, dimension. 
Like a goddess or god: appearing differently or not at all. 
Depending on which direction. 
Imagine a history that was unheard, not repeated. 
A theory of darkness, without light, color, shadow. 
Succulent.”

Fluid like the Waters bridges black feminist thought with black artistic practice to build on these 
questions, perceptions and traditions around the water and its memory.
